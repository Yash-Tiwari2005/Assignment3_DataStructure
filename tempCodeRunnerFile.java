ENCS205 - Data Structures
Assignment 03: Implementation of Trees and Graph Algorithms for Campus Navigation and Data Management
Language: Java (single-file implementation)

Deliverable: ENCS205 Java implementation covering:
- Building ADT
- Binary Search Tree (BST) with insert/search/inorder/preorder/postorder
- AVL Tree (with LL, RR, LR, RL rotations) and height comparison
- Graph representation: adjacency list and adjacency matrix
- BFS and DFS traversals
- Dijkstra's shortest path
- Kruskal's minimum spanning tree (using Union-Find)
- Expression tree evaluation (simple arithmetic)

Compile: javac ENCS205_Assignment03_Campus_Navigation_Planner.java
Run: java ENCS205_Assignment03_Campus_Navigation_Planner

Note: Adapt and modularize into multiple files if required by your submission format.
